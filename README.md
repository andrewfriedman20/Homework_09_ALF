# README Generator
  
  ## Description
  This project attempts to make the tedious less so. Writing readme files can be a drag after a long day of coding and testing. This app makes it easier on you by providing an easy way to automatically generate a README by answering a few questions in the command-line. Once you've completed entering the information, the app will process your responses, create a new README file and populate it with the data from your responses in the appropriate format(s). 

  ## Installation
 Please go to the command line and perform an npm install. This must be performed on one's local computer.
  

  ## Usage
The user should type "node index.js" in the command-line and press enter. The user should then answer each of the queries that appear and press enter to see the next. Towards the end, the user will select a license they would like to apply to their project. When the README Generator compiles the user's responses into a professional readme file, it will appear in the folder of the project and will be accessible in Visual Studio Pro.
